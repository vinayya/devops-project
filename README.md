# devops-project
Here I have created a dummy real world development environment Integrated with GIT + GITHUB + JENKINS + DOCKER

I have created 3 jobs in jenkins which servers 3 different tasks:

Job 1 : testing environment
This job servers the task of pulling the code from github test branch and runs on the testing environment.
